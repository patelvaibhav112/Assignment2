<p>Getting started with assignment 2. I just finished watching the lecture 4. Updated my model CalculatorBrain with the new enhancement as shown in the class demo. As a result of this enhancement, the model now accepts a id program that should be a string of operators and operands. The model takes this program "cookie" as professor Paul puts it, and processes it by recursively popping items off of the stack. Its a very nifty code. Stay tuned on my updates of Assignment 2 tasks. I am going to create a separate branch for each tasks and then merge them to Master as I am done with it.</p>
